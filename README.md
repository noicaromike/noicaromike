## About Me

<p>Funk-stack developer 🤘 — I’ve honed my skills through freelancing and solo projects, diving deep into all aspects of web development from planning to execution. I thrive on creating organized, scalable code that’s built for the long term, especially in startup environments where speed and adaptability are key — AKA a "tinker planner" 😉</p>
<p>Currently working at BizBox.inc</p>

## Availability
<p>Sat. and Sun.</p>
<p>Got an idea or some data you want to bring online? Let’s talk! I’m around on **Saturdays and Sundays** to help you figure out how to turn it into a working service — from concept to launch, with a little tech magic and tinker-planner energy. 😉 </p>
<p>I can help turn your paper ball into a paper plane ✈️ — let’s make it fly and build a better world together. 😄</p>
<p>I’m only one call away 🎵 — or, well... one email works too 😄</p>
